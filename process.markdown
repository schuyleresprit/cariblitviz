The Assignment


Create Caribbean interns enrolled in HIS115 for the academic year 2021-22 will contribute to this project by working to develop a multimedia resource documenting Caribbean literary history, particularly with a searchable, annotated, and mapped timeline of Caribbean literature from 1800 – the present.

We will begin by asking and answering these questions within the framework of some broad categories:


The Data

What data sets may we be interested in?

How do we locate the data/sets?

How do we store and catalog data?


The Tools


What are the most appropriate tools to learn more about the data/sets?

What are the challenges, limitations and obstacles to using specific tools?

Which tools will allow for the project’s longevity and sustainability?



The Methods


What literary approaches are we applying to our understanding of the data and of the visualizations that emerge from our engagement with the data?

What are our broad research questions about the Caribbean, literature, and Caribbean culture, based on what we find in the data?



The Stories


Periodization: the eras of literary production and main events, theories, values

People: the authors, readers, publishers, communities documented in literature

Infrastructure: the means and context of literary production, consumption, and reception

Places: the cartography of stories and storytelling within and about the Caribbean

Themes: the keywords emerging from the subjects and ideas relevant to primary sources
